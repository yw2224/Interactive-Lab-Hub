# ChatBot

yw2224@cornell.edu

In this lab, we will use a Raspberry Pi to create a chatbot! Your Pi will be serving up it's own webpages with an interface that allows people to type in text entries and receive your Chatbot's replies.

## Make the ChatBot your own

**Describe what changes you made to the baseline chatbot here. Don't forget to push your modified code to this repository.**

I made a conversation chatbot for the assignment. You can make small talk with it. For every sentence you say, the system uses a speech-recognition package to translate it into text, and calls the Dialogflow api for an AI response. It then outputs the response as a voice message, so that you can actually chat with the bot!

## Record someone trying out your ChatBot

**Using a phone or other video device, record someone trying out your ChatBot. Upload that video to this repository and link to it here!**
